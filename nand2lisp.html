<h2>V1: From Hack to Lisp machine</h2>

<p>
I finished the
<a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris book</a>
a while ago, building
<a href="https://github.com/deosjr/nand2tetris">my own tooling in Go</a>
to simulate a simple computer all the way up from NAND-gates.
After that I dove into
<a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html">SICP</a>
and went on to get a translation of Peter Norvig's
<a href="https://norvig.com/lispy.html">lispy</a>
running on the nand2tetris computer.
I left the project there to explore the wonderful world of Lisp more.
Now it is time to come back with all the things I've learned, and build a nand2tetris-style Lisp machine.
In this first post we will go over some ideas on how to modify the Hack computer and build something close to the lispy 'calculator'.

<h2>Computer Architecture and the LISP language</h2>

The core data structure in Lisp is the cons cell.
A lot of the time in evaluating s-expressions will be spent traversing this via the <i>car</i> and <i>cdr</i> commands.
The easiest way to represent this close to where the machine language can efficiently execute on it is to add another RAM16K chip next to the main memory in the Hack computer,
which will be addressed in the same way and at the same time. Each cycle we will fetch data from both RAM chips and feed it into the ALU.
The first RAM chip will represent the car and the second the cdr in memory.
We'll implement this using a builtin RAM32K chip, of which the second half will go unused.
This image is based on the Hack memory (additions in red):

<p>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp; <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in (16)</tt> &#10145;<td rowspan="3">
<table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><td align=center><tt><b>Data Memory</b>
<table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr style="background-color:#FFFFFF"><td align=center><br><br>RAM (16K)<br><br><br><td rowspan="3"><b style="color:red">Added RAM (32K)</b>
<tr style="background-color:#FFFFFF"><td align=center>Screen <br> memory map <br> (8K)
<tr style="background-color:#FFFFFF"><td align=center>Keyboard <br> memory map
</table>
</table><td>&#10145;&nbsp;<tt>car out (16)</tt>
<tr><td><tt>address (16)</tt> &#10145;<td>&#10145;&nbsp;<tt><b style="color:red">cdr out (16)</b></tt>
</table>

<p> This change makes addresses not just pointers into a flat list, but pointers into a list of cons cells (or pairs).
But not everything in Lisp is a pair: we have atoms which can be symbols or primitives such as numbers, and procedures.
This type information is crucial to handle s-expressions at this low level.
We can represent this by taking some bits of our 16-bit registers and encode type data in those.
This changes the Hack platform into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_architecture">tagged architecture</a>.
We'll use the first 3 bits, leaving us with only 13 to represent data with.
The alternative would be to extend the bitsize, but that would be a more drastic overall change.

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><th>Prefix<th width="23%">Type<th>Example

  <tr><td align=center>000<td>Pair<td><tt>(+ . (x . 3))</tt>
  <tr><td align=center>001<td>Empty list<td><tt>()</tt>
  <tr><td align=center>010<td>Primitive<td><tt>42</tt>
  <tr><td align=center>011<td>Symbol<td><tt>x</tt>
  <tr><td align=center>101<td>Builtin<td><tt>+</tt>
  <tr><td align=center>111<td>Special builtin<td><tt>lambda<tt>
  <tr><td align=center>100<td>Userdefined<td><tt>func<tt>

   </table>
</p>

The first 3 bits indicate ISPROCEDURE, ISATOM and ISSYMBOL respectively.
Their negations are ISEXPRESSION, ISPAIR and ISPRIMITIVE.
The last two missing combinations I will most likely use to represent special procedures, more on that later.
Note that the 16-bit numbers representation in Hack gets some features for free that we lose this way without modifying the ALU further, main one being negative numbers as 2's complement.
In return we get extremely low-level type checking, which I find more interesting to play with.

<p>One caveat is that we now have to be very careful not to confuse pointers to pairs with pairs themselves, as it all looks the same in memory.
In general, we'll assume that the stack only works with pointers and the heap only contains actual cons cells.

<p>At this point we have all the setup we need to build Lisp-specific machine instructions.
What's left is to define them and extend the ALU to recognise these new instructions and execute them without breaking the existing Hack ones.

<h2>Machine Language</h2>

Here's a refresher on the original Hack instructions and how a 16-bit word maps to functionality:

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><th>c<th colspan="2">free<th>a<th colspan="6">comp<th colspan="3">dest<th colspan="3">jump<th>instruction
  <tr><td>0<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>v<td>A-instruction: <i>@value</i>
  <tr><td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1<td>0<td>0<td>0<td>0<td>0<td>1<td>0<td>0<td>0<td>0<td>C-instruction: <i>dest=comp;jump</i>. In this case <tt>D=M</tt>
</table>

<p>
You can see two bits are completely unused.
We will call them <tt>b[1]</tt> and <tt>b[2]</tt>, or <tt>useALU</tt> and <tt>writeCdrM</tt> respectively.
The following modifications leave the Hack instructions unaltered, meaning the assembler will also still be valid.
<ul>
<li>If <tt>b[1]</tt> is high, we will use the Hack ALU like normal, but otherwise we will ignore its output completely and use our Lisp-specific gates.
<li>If <tt>b[2]</tt> is high, we will write the CDR output to the CDR RAM.
</ul>
Since the original Hack platform did not have this second RAM the ALU does not know or understand it: just to be sure we will never write to CDR from ALU.

<p>
This leaves at least 7 bits (<tt> a + comp </tt>) to switch between different instructions.
Even if we don't find an elegant way like the ALU to encode them together, we can make an ugly switch using Mux-gates.
Here's the ones I've found I needed to make eval work at the virtual machine level; their implementation in gates is left to the reader :)

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><th>Command<th>Instruction<th>Example

  <tr><td>SETCAR<td>1111001100001000<td>shorthand for <tt>M=D</tt>, not a new instruction
  <tr><td>SETCDR<td>1010111111000000<td>writes <tt>D</tt> to CDR register
  <tr><td>MCAR<td>1111110000010000<td>shorthand for <tt>D=M</tt>, not a new instruction. Maybe when we support typechecking.
  <tr><td>MCDR<td>1000011111010000<td>writes value of CDR register into <tt>D</tt>
  <tr><td>EQLM<td>1000010111010000<td>sets <tt>D</tt> to <tt>0xffff</tt> if <tt>M == D</tt>, otherwise <tt>0x0000</tt>
  <tr><td>ISSYMB<td>1000001011010000<td>checks tags of <tt>M</tt>, setting <tt>D</tt> to true or false the same way as <tt>EQLM</tt>
  <tr><td>ISPRIM<td>1000001010010000<td>similar but checking different prefix
  <tr><td>ISPROC<td>1000001101010000<td>checks first bit set to 1
  <tr><td>ISEMPTY<td>1000001001010000<td>all 4 of these reuse the same gates; prefix can be found in the instruction <tt>b[7:9]</tt>
  <tr><td>EMPTYCDR<td>1000000001010000<td>like the above but checks the CDR register instead
   </table>
</p>

<h2>Assembler</h2>

The changes to assembler, virtual machine and compiler are not that interesting.
Instead let's have a look at a program using these instructions, hand-written in extended Hack assembly.
In order to build the <tt>eval</tt> function we need one very important component that is not yet reflected in our types: the <i>environment</i>.

<p>
At its most basic, the environment is a mapping of symbols to s-expressions.
Norvig's lispy uses a dictionary; in <a href="https://github.com/deosjr/whistle">my own Golang-based Lisp interpreter</a> I do the same thing.
But we don't have to implement hashmaps: we already have lists! <br>
We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_list">association lists</a>, with the key being a symbol and the value an s-expression.

<pre class="prettyprint">
(ASSQ)
    // assume @R11 = K (key) and @R12 = P (pointer to assoc list)
    @R12
    A=M
    A=M
    D=M
    @R11
    EQLM
    @ASSQCONTINUE
    D;JEQ
    // here K == D !
    @R12
    A=M
    A=M
    MCDR
    @0x6002     // I've used this address to write to tape output
    M=D
    @END
    0;JMP
(ASSQCONTINUE)
    @R12
    A=M
    EMPTYCDR
    @FAILTOFIND
    D;JNE
    @R12
    A=M
    MCDR
    @R12
    M=D
    @ASSQ
    0;JMP
(FAILTOFIND)
    @END
    0;JMP
</pre>

That's pretty compact!

<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>

We could handroll <tt>eval</tt> in much the same way, but at some point using the stack abstraction speeds up the process a lot.
I've made a few modifications to the Hack virtual machine to better represent a functional language and get a graps for the differences.
First of all, we will do away with local variables and force all functions to take exactly one argument.
Local vars are not needed because we will use the environment, and since we have list we can pass a variadic amount of args by just passing a list pointer.
Local variables will make an appearance in <tt>eval</tt> but will refer to the first <tt>n</tt> items on the function's working stack.
Most functions are expected to not have to use this at all.

<p>
Instead of <tt>LCL</tt> we store a pointer to <tt>ENV</tt>, a pointer to the current environment we are evaluating in.
The <tt>THIS</tt> and <tt>THAT</tt> registers are also no longer needed, just like <tt>pointer</tt> and <tt>temp</tt>.
This simplifies things quite a bit: calling and returning from functions has less overhead.

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr><td align=right>ARG &#10145;<td>argument
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><td rowspan="3"><td>return address
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><td>saved ENV
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><td>saved ARG
  <tr><td align=right>SP &#10145;<td>working stack

   </table>
</p>

<h2>CONS and memory allocation</h2>
We want <tt>cons</tt> to be supported on the VM level: it consumes the top two items on the stack and creates a new cons cell on the heap.
If we push 4, then 7, then call cons, the result should be the cons cell <tt>(4 . 7)</tt>. <br>
In order to do so we must support some form of <i>alloc</i> at this abstraction level and we will do so making the following assumptions:

<ul>
<li> We only ever need to alloc one space at a time, ie only support <tt>alloc(1)</tt> for a cons cell
<li> At some point we will support compacting garbage collection, so we can always alloc downwards
</ul>

The solution for now is to keep a global variable <tt>FREE</tt> in memory. The first few registers now look like:

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><th>Register<th width="23%">Name<th>Usage

  <tr><td align=center>RAM[0]<td><tt>NIL</tt><td>indicates failure
  <tr><td align=center>RAM[1]<td><tt>SP</tt><td>stack pointer
  <tr><td align=center>RAM[2]<td><tt>ENV</tt><td>environment pointer
  <tr><td align=center>RAM[3]<td><tt>ARG</tt><td>argument pointer
  <tr><td align=center>RAM[4]<td><tt>FREE</tt><td>starts at 2048, base of heap

   </table>
</p>

The <tt>cons</tt> VM instruction can now be translated like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    @SP
    AM=M-1
    D=M
    @FREE
    A=M
    SETCDR
    @SP
    A=M-1
    D=M
    @FREE
    A=M
    SETCAR
    @FREE
    D=M
    M=D+1
    @SP
    A=M-1
    M=D
</pre>


<h2>Eval</h2>

We have all the tools to start building eval.
Here's a pseudocode version of the evaluation function we are going to build:

<pre class="prettyprint">
function eval(env, e):
    if e is a procedure:
        return e
    // e is guaranteed to be an expression
    if e is an atom:
        if e is a symbol:
            return env.lookup(e)
        // e is guaranteed to be a primitive
        return e
    // e is guaranteed to be a pair
    f, args = e[0], e[1:]     // unpack the list e
    f = eval(env, f)
    args = map(eval, args)
    return f(args)
</pre>

This means we do not support any keywords like <tt>lambda</tt> or <tt>define</tt> yet.
In fact, the only function we will support is addition, represented by the symbol <tt>+</tt>.
Since all our functions take only a single argument, we will have to pass in the list 
<tt>(env e)</tt>. This is then manipulated on the stack using car and cdr.
Let's start writing the eval function in VM language:

<pre class="prettyprint">
// (eval env e) -> evaluation of e in env, or NIL if error
// NOTE env is an argument, not ENV, which is a reference to the evaluating environment.
// TODO: if first argument is not an env assoc list (how?), use *ENV instead, ie support (eval e)
function eval
    push constant 0     // prepare local 0 = e
    push constant 0     // prepare local 1 = evaluated procedure
    push constant 0     // prepare local 2 = num args
    push argument
    cdr
    car
    pop local 0         // store e in lcl0
    push local 0
    is-procedure
    if-goto evalself
    push local 0
    is-symbol
    if-goto evalsymbol
    push local 0
    is-primitive
    if-goto evalself
    // guaranteed to be a pair!
</pre>

The start of our evaluating function is doing most of the type-based branching.
Note that we do use local variables here which we have to prepare explicitly by pushing zeroes on the working stack.
Most other functions will use the env to set local variables, but we will need <tt>define</tt> first for that.

<p>
We enter the more complicated <i>evalpair</i> before others because of the fallthrough in the above type switch.
All it does here is to evaluate the car of e, which is expected to yield a procedure.
If it does, we jump to <i>evalargs</i> which is explained later.
This is the first time we see how to call the eval function from the VM: pushing arguments on the stack and cons-ing them into one list pointer argument.

<pre class="prettyprint">
label evalpair
    push argument
    car                 // env on the stack
    push local 0
    car
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    call eval.eval
    pop local 1
    push local 1        // evalled procedure
    is-procedure
    if-goto evalargs
    // attempt to apply non-procedure
    push constant 0
    return
</pre>

Procedures and primitives evaluate to themselves.
Symbols we look up in the environment using <tt>ASSQ</tt>, or in this case its VM translation <tt>assoc.assq</tt>.
The latter takes the list <tt>(env e)</tt> as its argument so we can just pass the full argument to eval.

<pre class="prettyprint">
label evalself
    push local 0
    return
label evalsymbol
    push argument
    call assoc.assq
    return
</pre>

Here is where things get really interesting.
Before calling the procedure, we need to evaluate the arguments that are being passed in.
We can traverse the input list until we hit emptylist marking the end, call eval on each element, and leave the results on the stack.
In order to cons the correct amount of times at the end, we'll keep <tt>numargs</tt> in a separate local var. <br>
Due to how cons works we can only cons at the end unfortunately or this would not be needed.

<pre class="prettyprint">
label evalargs
    // we will need to build ( evaluatedargs ... )
    // on the stack, then call the evaluated func with those args
    push local 0
    cdr
    // if emptylist, we ran out of args
    is-emptylist
    if-goto evalprocedure
    push local 2
    push constant 1
    add
    pop local 2         // numargs++
    push local 0
    cdr
    pop local 0
    push argument
    car                 // env on the stack
    push local 0
    car
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    call eval.eval      // returns evalled arg, or NIL if error
    goto evalargs
</pre>

At this point we should have all arguments evaluated and waiting on the stack.
The procedure to call is stored in local variable 1.
Here we create the list of arguments by calling cons <tt>numargs</tt> times after pushing the end marker.

<pre class="prettyprint">
label evalprocedure
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
// cons numargs times
label consloop
    push constant 0
    push local 2
    eq
    if-goto call
    cons
    push local 2
    push constant 1
    sub
    pop local 2
    goto consloop
// actually call the function stored in local 1
label call
    // TODO
    call eval.add
    return
</pre>

For this first version we will leave this at a hardcoded goto, but the procedure could either be referencing a builtin one, a user-defined one (using <tt>lambda</tt>),
or a special one like <tt>lambda</tt>, <tt>define</tt> or <tt>if</tt>, each codifying different jumps around instruction memory.

<p>
The actual implementation of <tt>add</tt> is pretty straightforward, but we have to remember to mask the result to keep the type tag intact.
Probably a lot faster if hand-rolled in assembly, but then we'd have to think about how to jump to it correctly.

<pre class="prettyprint">
// TODO: make variadic, just have to check emptylist in a loop
function add
    push argument
    car
    push argument
    cdr
    car
    add
    // NOTE: primitives are prefixed with 010
    push constant 8191  // 0x1fff
    and
    push constant 16384 // 0x4000
    or
    return
</pre>

<h2>Compiler</h2>

The Lisp compiler is mainly a parser that can read s-expressions, then writes VM instructions writing the parsed expressions into starting memory.
The actual environment is still hardcoded in a separate VM-file and loaded during init, but the main function below is now generated from a lisp file.

<pre class="prettyprint">
function main
    push constant 100   // pointer to ENV, set in sys.vm
    push constant 16426 // primitive(42)
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    call eval.eval
    write               // expect 0x402a, the number 42

    push constant 100   // pointer to ENV, set in sys.vm
    push constant 24578 // symbol(2) representing 'x', bound to primitive(7) in ENV
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    call eval.eval
    write               // expect 0x4007, the number 7

    push constant 100   // pointer to ENV, set in sys.vm
    push constant 24581 // symbol(5) representing '+', bound to builtin(0) in ENV
    push constant 24578 // symbol(2) representing 'x', bound to primitive(7) in ENV
    push constant 16419 // primitive(35)
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    cons
    push constant 8192  // 0x2000 = emptylist
    cons
    cons
    call eval.eval      // evaluate (+ x 35)
    write               // expect 0x402a, the number 42

    push constant 0     // void return
    return

</pre>

The compiler uses a <i>symbol table</i>, storing string->symbol lookups.
It simply keeps a counter and adds a key-value pair when it sees a symbol it has never seen before.
I've added a few initial symbols by hand; this table will become more useful once we implement <tt>define</tt>.

<h2>Background and what's next</h2>

The nand2tetris book, or <i>The Elements of Computing Systems</i> by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, describes
multiple levels of a functioning computer.
I followed it from the configuration of gates to make chips through machine language,
assembly, a virtual machine and finally the high level language Jack.
The only real modification to the setup that I ended up making was allowing for the bitshift operation because multiplication felt too slow.
For this I implemented a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_shifter">barrel shifter</a>
circuit, and plugging this in meant extending all the abstracting layers.
The CPU had to support a new instruction bypassing the ALU, the assembler had to recognize the new instruction, and if I had wanted to I could've exposed this all the way into Jack
(or its Golang equivalent in my case).

<p>
The book includes a short postscript with ideas on how to extend the project. 
One of those is to replace Jack with a Scheme.
In this series of posts I will take that idea a bit further and build a lisp machine with minimal modifications to the nand2tetris computer architecture and its Hack machine language.
It assumes familiarity with the book, as if it is just another chapter at the end.
The aim is to have a Lisp <tt>eval</tt> loop as close to the metal as possible and understand the benefits of running Lisp as both operating system and application.
</p>

<p>
Next time we will implement some special procedures like <tt>if</tt> that do not necessarily evaluate all their arguments, properly switch between those and builtin procedures, and
add type errors on the chip level.
