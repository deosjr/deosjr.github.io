    <h2>Adventures in Dynamicland</h2>
    <p>This page runs on Scheme->WebAssembly using <a href="https://spritely.institute/hoot/">Hoot</a>. It implements a reverse-engineered RealTalk, the logic engine behind Bret Victor's <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">Dynamicland</a>. The purpose of this page is to document the implementation for people like me who want to build their own.</p>
    <p>Notably this page goes against some of the design principles of Dynamicland: it is not intended to be a replacement in any way. But Dynamicland is not publicly available, and Oakland is pretty far away. So with apologies to Bret, let's have a look at RealTalk as I've reverse engineered it and explore some of its concepts.</p>
