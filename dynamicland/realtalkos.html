    <div class=code>
(define (reset-page-style! pagediv)
  (let ((left (get-left pagediv))
        (top (get-top pagediv))
        (transform (get-transform pagediv))
        (z (get-z-index pagediv)))
    (set-style! pagediv "")
    (set-style-left! pagediv left)

    (set-style-transform! pagediv transform)
    (set-z-index! pagediv z)))
    </div>
    <p>Our RealTalkOS so far solves this by resetting each page every loop.
       This is inefficient but simple, and therefore a good starting point.
       One area I am still investigating is how to accurately handle effects over time.
       In my first version I simply deleted the Datalog db every iteration and built it up again!
       That results in pages not able to reason about variables over time unless the capture global vars in a closure, something that goes against the entire Dynamicland model.
       The way we have set things up now pages only run their top-level code once and introduce Claims / When-rules once, and it is dl-fixpoint that runs repeatedly.
       I imagine properly distinguishing between top-level Claims and derived Claims and effects will go a long way here.
