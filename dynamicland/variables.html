    <h2>Variables and scope</h2>
    <p>So far we have only seen direct interaction of pages through the Claim/Wish/When model.
       We wipe the datalog database frequently to get rid of old invalid assertions.
       But what if we want pages to remember previous state?</p>
    <div id=pages class="pages"></div>
    <p id=table class="table" style="height:60vh; width:60vh;"></p>
    <p>Here we have two pages. Page #2 includes all of the logic we saw in <a href="/dynamicland/whiskers.html">whiskers</a>.
       Page #1 showcases how to declare variables in the scope of a page.
       It will cycle through four different colors, changing color whenever pointed at, but maintaining that color as long as the pointer still points at it.</p>
    <div class=code>
(define page1 (add-page (make-page-code
  (define colors (list "green" "blue" "yellow" "red"))
  (define index -1)
  (define pointed-at #f)

  (When ((points-at ,?p ,this)
         (gives-color ,?p #t)) do
    (if (not pointed-at)
      (set! index (modulo (+ index 1) (length colors))))
    (set! pointed-at #t)
    (set-background! (get-page this) (list-ref colors index)))

  (When ((not-points-at ,?p ,this)
         (gives-color ,?p #t)) do
    (if pointed-at (set! pointed-at #f))))))
    </div>
    <p>Before we can talk about variables we have to address one thing: negation.
       Datalog does not deal with the concept of negation, by default, and we haven't added it in. 
       This means that in order to detect whether a page is pointed or not, we need to explicitly declare both states.
       Luckily we can amend the previous pointing-at logic minimally to reflect this:</p>
    <div class=code>
(define page2 (add-page (make-page-code
  (Wish this 'has-whiskers #t)
  (Claim this 'gives-colour #t)

   ; [...] When ?p is pointing at ?point and ?q exists [...]
   do (let ((px (car ?point))
            (py (cdr ?point)))
        (if (and (> px ?qx)
                 (< px (+ ?qx ?qw))
                 (> py ?qy)
                 (< py (+ ?qy ?qh)))
           (Claim ?p 'points-at ?q)
           (Claim ?p 'not-points-at ?q)))) ; <-- new!
    </div>
    <p>We now have the fact 'p does not point at q' explicitly available in the db if it is the case.
       Page #1 uses this to declare to When-statements: one for when it is pointed at and one for when it is not.
       It declares three locally scoped variables to keep track of its internal state: colors, index and pointed-at.
       Pointed-at is a boolean that is always updated to reflect whether page #1 is being pointed at.
       It can be used to do edge detection: we can know whether we were pointed at the last time fixpoint analysis triggered!</p>

    <p>Only when there is a change in being pointed at do we update the index into the list of colors we can set as background.
       The reason this works is that the page's code is ran once when the page enters the table.
       Any variable declared in this scope can be captured as a closure in a rule (the macro-expansion of When), which lets it live on.
       Each time a rule triggers, these variables can be referenced.
       This is a powerful way to set up dependencies between rules, but only within the scope of a single page.
       Beyond that pages will have to use Claims in order to communicate state between each other.</p>
    <p>But there is a subtle state-related problem we haven't mentioned yet.
       If a page's code runs only once, the Claims that it makes are made once and should linger until the page leaves the table.
       However, if a Claim is made as result of a When rule, that assertion should only be valid as long as the conditions are valid.
       Instead of checking for this exhaustively we clear the database each iteration and derive these Claims again.
       This means there should be a difference between top-level Claims and Claims nested in a When-clause.</p>
    <p>At some point that should be handled in a macro.
       For now, I add this bit of code to handle nested Claims (and deal with some remaining macro hygiene issues by side-stepping them):</p>
    <div class=code>
  (define (claim-point-at p q)
    (hashtable-set! (datalog-idb (get-dl)) `(,this claims (,p points-at ,q)) #t)
    (hashtable-set! (datalog-idb (get-dl)) `(,p points-at ,q) #t)
    (Claim p 'points-at q))
    </div>
    <p>Here we make sure to add some facts to datalog-idb, the table of derived facts, whenever we make a derived Claim.
       Each iteration of fixpoint analysis starts with cleaning up all derived facts, so these Claims get removed.
       Problem solved!</p>
