    <p>A faithful implementation of Dynamicland consists of at least these components:
       <ul>
       <li>A way to recognize pages from video</li>
       <li>A way to project onto those pages</li>
       <li>A way to associate code with pages and manage their effects</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>My first attempt at creating something like this I called <a href="https://github.com/deosjr/elephanttalk">ElephantTalk</a>.
       The picture on top is how I usually ran it: with a webcam and a short-throw projector attached to my laptop.
       It would run a Go program that did all of the above in a loop.</p>
    <p>Sadly I couldn't get the page detection to be stable and the project stalled.
       This project is mostly a write-up from what I learned from writing ElephantTalk.</p>
